# Data Summary Report: Outbound Travel Patterns of Taiwanese Nationals (2013–2024)

## Data Description

The dataset, `歷年中華民國國民出國年齡統計2013-2024.csv`, provides a comprehensive record of outbound travel by Taiwanese nationals from 2013 to 2024, dis aggregated by age group, destination region, and specific destination country/region. The data is presumed to originate from official sources, such as Taiwan’s Ministry of Transportation or Immigration Agency, as detailed in the codebook (`week14-hw-codebook.md`). The dataset comprises 614 observations across 10 variables, capturing the number of travelers in seven age groups (12 and under, 13–19, 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, and 60 and above), the total number of travelers, the destination region (`首站抵達地`), specific destination (`細分`), and year (`年別`). The destination regions include Asia, Africa, the Americas, Oceania, Europe, and a grand total category, with 40 unique specific destinations (e.g., Japan, China, Hong Kong). The data is structured in a long-format CSV, with no missing values, though zero values in certain regions (e.g., Africa) may indicate unrecorded data (see `week14-hw-codebook.md`).

The dataset’s primary utility lies in analyzing temporal trends in outbound travel, age-specific travel preferences, and regional destination patterns. It is particularly valuable for studying the impact of external shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on travel behavior. The codebook highlights the dataset’s completeness and consistency, with the total number of travelers (`合計`) equaling the sum of age-specific counts, though data sparsity in regions like Africa and Oceania warrants caution in analysis.

## Data Summary

The dataset provides a robust foundation for examining outbound travel patterns among Taiwanese nationals over the 2013–2024 period. A single-variable summary (`variable_summary.json`) confirms the dataset’s structure and characteristics. The `年別` variable, an integer ranging from 2013 to 2024, shows a uniform distribution with approximately 41 observations per year, indicating balanced temporal coverage with no missing values. The `首站抵達地` variable, a categorical factor with six levels (Asia, Africa, Americas, Oceania, Europe, and grand total), reveals Asia as the dominant destination region, accounting for 216 observations (approximately 35% of the dataset), while Africa is the least represented (36 observations, ~6%). The `細分` variable, with 41 unique categories, includes specific destinations and regional totals, with Japan, China, and Hong Kong among the most frequently recorded. Numeric variables, including the seven age groups and total travelers (`合計`), are integers with ranges consistent with the codebook (e.g., `12歲以下` from 0 to 1,225,828; `合計` from 0 to 17,101,335). No missing values are observed across any variables, aligning with the codebook’s assertion of data completeness, though zero values in smaller regions (e.g., Africa) suggest potential underreporting.

A multi-variable analysis of total outbound travelers by year and region (`year_region_total.json`) underscores Asia’s dominance, with annual totals ranging from 465,472 in 2021 (pandemic low) to 31,571,998 in 2024, reflecting a strong recovery post-COVID-19. The grand total (`全區`) peaked at 17,176,932 in 2019, plummeted to 360,842 in 2021 due to pandemic restrictions, and rebounded to 16,855,215 by 2024. Other regions, such as Europe (peak 1,075,554 in 2018) and the Americas (peak 1,423,078 in 2018), show smaller but significant contributions, while Africa consistently records minimal activity (e.g., 752 travelers in 2024).

Age-specific travel patterns for the top five destinations—Japan, China, Hong Kong, Korea, and Thailand—(`top_dest_age_distribution.json`) reveal distinct preferences. Japan attracts the highest average number of travelers across age groups, particularly the 30–39 age group (768,669 travelers), followed by China, where the 50–59 age group dominates (627,570 travelers). Hong Kong and Korea appeal strongly to the 30–39 and 20–29 age groups, while Thailand shows a more balanced age distribution. These patterns suggest that younger and middle-aged travelers (20–49) are the primary drivers of outbound tourism to major Asian destinations.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on age-specific travel is evident in the comparison of pre-pandemic (2013–2019) and pandemic/post-pandemic (2020–2024) periods (`pandemic_age_proportion.json`). Pre-pandemic, the 30–39 age group accounted for 22.06% of travelers, followed by 40–49 (20.79%) and 50–59 (18.4%). During and after the pandemic, the 30–39 share decreased to 19.65%, while the 60-and-above group increased from 15.07% to 17.92%, indicating a shift toward older travelers post-2020, possibly due to relaxed restrictions and pent-up demand among retirees.

Finally, an analysis of yearly growth rates for Japan, China, and Hong Kong (`yearly_growth_top_dest.json`) highlights the pandemic’s disruption and subsequent recovery. Japan’s outbound travelers grew steadily from 2,346,007 in 2013 to 4,915,681 in 2019 (27.80% growth in 2015), but plummeted by 85.79% in 2020 and 97.99% in 2021. Recovery was dramatic, with a 2421.31% growth in 2022 and 1092.99% in 2023, reaching 6,006,116 travelers in 2024. China and Hong Kong followed similar trajectories, with growth rates exceeding 960% and 1310%, respectively, in 2023, reflecting a robust rebound in Asian travel.

In summary, the dataset reveals a dynamic outbound travel market heavily concentrated in Asia, with significant age-specific and temporal variations. The 30–49 age groups dominate, but older travelers (60 and above) gained prominence post-pandemic. The data’s consistency and completeness, as verified by the codebook, support robust analyses, though caution is advised for sparse regions like Africa. These findings provide a foundation for further econometric modeling of travel demand and policy impacts.
